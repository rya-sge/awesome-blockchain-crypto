## Official documentation

| Title                                                        | Description                                                  |

| [Interest Rates](https://docs.compound.finance/interest-rates/) | Users with a positive balance of the base asset earn interest, denominated in the base asset, based on a supply rate model; users with a negative balance pay interest based on a borrow rate model. |
| [Collateral & Borrowing](https://docs.compound.finance/collateral-and-borrowing/) | Users can add collateral assets to their account using the *[supply](https://docs.compound.finance/collateral-and-borrowing/#supply)* function. Collateral can only be added if the market is below its *[supplyCap](https://docs.compound.finance/helper-functions/#get-asset-info-by-address)*, which limits the protocolâ€™s risk exposure to collateral assets. |
| [Liquidation](https://docs.compound.finance/liquidation/)    | Liquidation is determined by *[liquidation collateral factors](https://docs.compound.finance/helper-functions/#get-asset-info-by-address)*, which are separate and higher than borrow collateral factors (used to determine initial borrowing capacity), which protects borrowers & the protocol by ensuring a price buffer for all new positions. |
| [Account Management](https://docs.compound.finance/account-management/) | In addition to self-management, Compound III accounts can enable other addresses to have write permissions for their account. Account managers can withdraw or transfer collateral within the protocol on behalf of another account. |
| [Protocol Rewards](https://docs.compound.finance/protocol-rewards/) | Compound III has a built-in system for tracking rewards for accounts that use the protocol. The full history of accrual of rewards are tracked for suppliers and borrowers of the base asset. |
| [Governance](https://docs.compound.finance/governance/)      | Compound III is a decentralized protocol that is governed by holders and delegates of COMP. |
| [Helper Functions](https://docs.compound.finance/helper-functions/) | List of useful functions                                     |
