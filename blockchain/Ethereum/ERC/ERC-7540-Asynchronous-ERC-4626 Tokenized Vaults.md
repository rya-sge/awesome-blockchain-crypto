# ERC-7540

https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7540

A new Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP-7540) is being introduced to modify the existing ERC-4626 tokenized vault standard by adding asynchronous deposit and redemption flows. 

The current ERC-4626 standard allows for atomic "all or nothing" transactions, but the proposed EIP-7540 would accommodate asynchronous transactions, enabling conditions to be met before an action is completed. This could be particularly beneficial for protocols dealing with real-world assets (RWAs), cross-chain lending, and liquid staking.
