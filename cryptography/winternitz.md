| [IOTA Signatures, Private Keys and Address Reuse?](http://blog.lekkertech.net/blog/2018/03/07/iota-signatures/) | This blog post reports my thought process about the theft, details a (mitigated) vulnerability that could have been used, explores if address reuse was a root cause, and whether address reuse was even necessary for the vulnerability to be exploited. | 03/2018 | Article        | [Lekkertech](http://blog.lekkertech.net/)                    |
